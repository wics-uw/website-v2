### Development Tips

#### Naming Convention

- For new features: `initial/feature/ticket#`, the ticket # will be the Jira ticket that you are working on

#### Pull Requests & Commits

- Always write a descriptive commit message in the following format: `ticket#: description`
- Write a detailed, but not overly detailed description of the feature or bug fixes when creating a PR

#### Other Tips

- Always run `yarn install` after pulling from master or checking out to a remote branch
- Always update your local master branch by running `git pull` everytime a PR is merged to minimize the need to resolve conflicts when you are creating a PR
